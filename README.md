## Usage

Just install `Synth_Maxima.ttf` font into your system and pick icons you like.
There's also a WOFF version of a font.

## Sources

There are three directories with SVG files: `sheet`, `src_units` and `units`.
Sheet simply contains a full sheet with all icons.
One called `src_units` contains SVG files, resized from an initial `sheet`,
called `icons_fixed.svg`.
One called `units` contains vector shapes for FontForge import.
